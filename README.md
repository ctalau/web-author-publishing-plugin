Publishing support for Web Author
=================================

This plugin adds a **Generate PDF** action in the contextual menu of Web Author. 

It sends the document to be published to a publishing service and retrieves the PDF file. Currently it works with https://github.com/ctalau/xmlpaper-lambda as a backend publishing service.


TODO: 
- add options page with the publishing service URL
- send a ZIP file with all the refrences.
