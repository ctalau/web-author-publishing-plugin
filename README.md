Publishing support for Web Author
=================================

This plugin sends the document to be published to a publishing service. Currently it works best with https://github.com/ctalau/xmlpaper-lambda as a backend.


TODO: 
- add options page with the publishing service URL
- send a ZIP file with all the refrences.
